# Heart Risk Stage Prediction Project

## Description
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. It includes a comprehensive data analysis performed in a Jupyter notebook and a Flask web application for deploying the predictive model. The project aims to leverage clinical data to make accurate predictions about heart disease, serving as a tool for healthcare analytics.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset, `heart.csv`, comprises 303 entries with 14 features related to heart health, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more. It's utilized for training various machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease.

## Installation and Setup

### For Jupyter Notebook
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### For Flask Application
To run the web application:

1. Install Flask:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

2. Run the Flask app:

    ```bash
    python heartattack.py
    ```

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebook
The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Run the notebook cell by cell to understand the data analysis process and model building.

### Flask Application
Run the Flask app and navigate to the provided local URL. Input the required data in the web interface to receive a heart disease risk prediction.

## Features

### Data Analysis
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Comparative analysis of various machine learning models

### Flask Web Application
- User-friendly web interface for data input
- Real-time predictions using the trained machine learning model

## Code Examples

### Data Visualization Example (Jupyter Notebook)
```python
pd.crosstab(data.sex, data.output).plot(kind="bar", figsize=(15, 6), color=['#1CA53B', '#AA1111'])
plt.title('Heart Disease Frequency for Sex')
plt.xlabel('Sex (0 = Female, 1 = Male)')
plt.show()
```

### Flask App Prediction Route
```python
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def predict():
    # Code to receive input data and return prediction
```
